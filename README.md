# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign
<h2>Overview of Project</h2>
<strong><h3>Purpose</h3></strong>
<p>Louise, a playwright, is looking to us analyze information gathered to determine how she will navigate her dream of being able to successfully fund her play _Fever_.  With an estimated budget of over $10,000.00, she wants to ensure that the necessary information is available to allow her to have a successful fundraising campaign.  
<p>With over 4000 campaigns analyzed we can see globally how different categories faired during their campaigns. Were they Successful, did they fail, or did they just not make the cut? What financial goals did they set; did they achieve them? With so many questions, we have relied on data to make an educated prediction on how much, when, and if Louise’s play _Fever_ has potential for success. 
<h3>Analysis and Challenges</h3>
<h4>Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date</h4>
<p>Analyzing the data, knowing Louise wants to produce a play there are two main variables, Launch Date and Fundraising Goals. As you’re able to see in the first example, the optimal time to launch a campaign is in May with the lowest month in December. Louise will be most successful launching her campaigns in the warmer months, more specifically April through August
 

 
 
 
 
<p><h4>Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals</h4>
<p>According to the data, visualized below, Louise's goal of just over $10,000.0.0 puts herself in the middle of the pack. Since Louise has pre-set her goal she has room to adjust to allow for unnecessary expenses, or shortcommings.
 

 
 
 
 
<h3>Challenges and Difficulties Encountered</h3></strong>
There were no challenges in helping Louise. She knew what what type of product she to produce and how much she wanted to spend. The rest was up to the data.  This was an ideal data set to help her get her feet off the ground and potentially help her with her future endeavors.
<strong><h3>Results</h3></strong>
<p>Looking at this dataset there in an incredible amount of information, once we sort, filter, extract, and analyze here are some of the conclusions that have been made.

  * Louise will do best if she launches her campaign in the warmer months, specifically April through August. People seemingly are more giving when the weather is warm.

  * Louise, as stated above, is in the middle of the pack with her funding expectations. She has room to increase her budget but must do so carefully. Too little and she could risk quality, too much and she might not meet her goal. 

  * There are some limitations to this dataset. The one most prevalent is that the data is a bit out of date. I also believe that diving into different parts of the US would be helpful. The datasets could be more specific to the area of the country in which a category might have more success.
